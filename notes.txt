            I had to write in and thank Eddie and his men for doing such a great job
            on my new kitchen. They went out of their way to make sure everything was
            just right. I would definetly recommend Eddie to my friends.

            We have had several bad experiences with painters in the past so we are always 
            looking for a good painter. I am happy to say we have finally found someone.
            The most important part of the job is the prep work and Eddie and his crew 
            were fabulous on prep. Even my very critical husband was impressed. They were
            on time, polite, and very meticulous about their work. I highly recommend.
